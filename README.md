* Questions to ask ourselves to write a paper (J. Mummolo and  S. Gordon)
  1. What is the research question?
  2. Why do we care? Why don't we already know the answer? Why is it hard? (What has gone overlooked; what did prior work get wrong? Could be theoretical or empirical)
  3. What you did to answer the question that was new.
  4. What what did we learn?
